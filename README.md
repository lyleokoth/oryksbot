# oryksbot - A differential Drive Robot Kit for learning ROS

This repository contains all the files and code needed to simulate the oryksbot, a differential robot, using [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)  and [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).
The software runs on [ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) and [Ubuntu 20.04](http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). If you want to use a different ROS version, you might have to do some changes to the source code.

The aim was to come up with an affordable robotics kit for learning mobile robotics using [The Robot Operating System(ROS)](https://www.ros.org/)
